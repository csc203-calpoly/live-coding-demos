# CSC 203 Project-based Object-oriented Programming and Design

These are coursenotes and "start states" for the Java code I use while teaching.
I teach by live-coding, so examples have intentional gaps that I fill in during lectures.

For most lectures, the code example is pretty much the only resource for the time being.
I am writing more detailed coursenotes as I get time.

## Typical schedule

Ignore the numbers in the subdirectory names. Those represent the order the first few times I taught the class, but things have moved around since then.

I usually teach this on MWF for 10 weeks. Some topics invariably take more days than I plan, some days are devoted to Q&A for projects, etc. So there is some wiggle room in the schedule below.
